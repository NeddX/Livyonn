// Currently supports two datatypes, Ints and strings.
//		string str = "my string";
//		int myint = 10;

// Has 3 built-in functions.
//		_Print(<str, str var, str expr>)		-		Prints the string and does not insert a newline at the end.
//		_Println(<str, str var, str expr>)		-		Same as above except inserts a new line at the end.
//		_PrintInt(<int, int var, int expr>)		-		Same as Print() but for ints only.

// Supports int expressions and re-assignments
// 		int a = 10 * 3;
//		int b = a - 1;
//		a = b * 10;

// Supports string addition and re-assignments
//		string str = "str 1";
//		string str2 = "str 2";
//		str = str + " " + str2;

// Supports function calls and return (only able to return ints and can't pass parameters yet)
//		my_func();
//		int a = retNum() * 10;

// Supports adding external files.
//		include FileName;
//		include "File name if spaces";
//		include FileNameWithExtension.arm;
//		
//		Just like C/C++, include actually replaces the include directive with the contents of the file specified.

// That's pretty much it
